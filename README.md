## Key Insights
  -  High dependency on top-performing staff (Nancy) could be a risk if performance isn’t replicated across the team.
  -  A small customer base may limit growth — there's opportunity to acquire more customers or explore B2C channels.
  -  Seasonal sales peaks in June and December could be leveraged with targeted promotions in those periods.
  -  North and East regions are most profitable — future campaigns or new product launches should be concentrated there.
  -  Underperforming regions and products should be evaluated for retargeting or product repositioning.

## Observations
  - Revenue:
     Total revenue for 2014 was 435.04K with peak months in June and December, suggesting possible seasonal influences.
     Nancy Freehafer led all sales staff in performance, contributing 104.24K, the highest among her peers.

  - Sales Distribution:
        Coffee generated the highest product revenue, followed by Curry Sauce and Marmalade.
        Sales were concentrated in North and East regions, while the West recorded the lowest revenue.

   - Customer & Product Volume:
        The business served 15 customers across 25 products, indicating a high product-to-customer ratio.
     
   - Payment Preferences:
        Credit card payments dominated, totaling 172.3K, indicating strong adoption of cashless transactions.
        Cash payments were the least used (38.4K), showing a shift away from traditional payment methods.

   - Monthly Performance:
        Noticeable dips occurred in July and August, possibly due to external seasonal or operational factors.

## Recommendations

  - Staff Training & Incentivization:
        Use Nancy Freehafer’s performance as a benchmark to train or mentor lower-performing staff.
        Introduce performance-based incentives to encourage consistent contributions across the sales team.

  - Customer Base Expansion:
         With only 15 customers, focus on customer acquisition strategies to increase market penetration.
        Consider launching targeted promotions or loyalty programs to attract and retain more clients.

  - Regional Focus Strategy:
        Invest in marketing and sales efforts in the West region to address its low performance.
        Analyze why the North and East regions perform better and replicate those practices in weaker regions.

   - Product Optimization:
        Promote high-performing products like Coffee more aggressively.
        Consider discontinuing or rebranding underperforming products to streamline inventory.

   - Seasonal Planning:
        Plan major campaigns, launches, and inventory around June and December, the peak revenue months.
        Investigate mid-year dips (July/August) and implement strategies (e.g., discounts, new product trials) to boost engagement.
